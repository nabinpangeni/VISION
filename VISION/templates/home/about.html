        <p>
          In today's world understanding between one another has been an issue, due to various conditions. Now the era of Artificial Intelligence has started, so as to carry it along with us and understand how it works. We are introducing NLP: one of the major tools to make machines understand human language, analyze, summarize and generate responses accordingly.<br>
           
          Our website not only provides a platform for one to post about something but also analyze, summarize, change it into speech and translate it into various other languages so that it will be easy for all users to understand anything that is on the website. Nonetheless, in our website we have also looked after the comment section improvement where those who comment are also looking after their response as a sentiment analysis and categorized their comment as a positive, negative or neutral response. Adding more on it our system has a text to speech feature where an article or blog can be heard; it is especially for those who are unable to see or for those who love to hear out rather than studying it. Despite this entire feature our system is incomplete without text translation to various languages so that not only the author native language reader but also all the readers around the globe can read and hear those articles and blogs. Last but not the least we also have a feature of Chatbot which will automatically respond to any queries from the users.<br> 
            As per we (the team) have researched about various other features which will be improvised and implemented on this system in the coming future looking after the response from the users feedback.<br>
